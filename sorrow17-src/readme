Since @endle asks contributors to attach their original code if their plugins for Hubot are wittren in non-coffee(or java)script, I put a directory here to storage all the code and configuration files required to build js plugins. 

Current plugins:
- avrg: a trivial statistics plugin which calculates the average of input numbers
usage: hubot avrg num0 num1 num2 ...
example: -> hubot avrg 0 2 7   ----------------  output: 9
